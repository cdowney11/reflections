What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created in your repository location. This folder keeps track of all the meta data for your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains files that are going to be added to the repository that are not already added to the repository. There may be additional files in the working directory that are not in the repository nor the staging area. This gives the user control over what is added to the repository and what is not. It also alows you to confirm which files you add before you do.
